## Threat Detection Watchdog Device

### Problem Statement
Armed robberies and assaults are a menace to the lives and assets of the
victims and require swift action to be resolved.
In those circumstances, the identification and reporting of danger are
left, most of the time, at the hands of the endangered. This causes a delay
between the threat recognition moment and the moment when authorities
take action. This means that any technology that can eliminate that delay
might help to save people and property.
In response to that matter, this product aims to help identify and report
threats resorting to a weapon recognition system powered by computer vision.
Upon detecting a dangerous situation, the device will send useful information
like surveillance footage frames, the number of weapons identified, and their
position in the environment to a human operator.
